## Requirements

- Python 3.x (recommended version 3.6+)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/simple-python-calculator.git](https://github.com/Yoan-Zdrave-Alex/project-repo)
   cd simple-python-calculator
   ```

2. Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

3. If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. To run the calculator, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and choose an operation:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

4. After performing the operation, the result will be displayed. You can continue to perform calculations or exit the program.

## Example Run

```bash
Welcome to Simple Python Calculator

Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit

Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

## Code Explanation

### Functions
- **add(x, y)**: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
- **subtract(x, y)**: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
- **divide(x, y)**: Returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`.

### Main Loop
The program runs in a loop, allowing users to choose operations until they select "Exit". It takes user input for numbers and operations, and displays results accordingly.
